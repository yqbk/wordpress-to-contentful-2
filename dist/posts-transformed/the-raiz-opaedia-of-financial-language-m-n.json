If you’re new, this is the explanation of complicated investment and financial words that you might have heard somewhere.\n\nIt’s valuable to have knowledge as the foundation, while you get familiar with your investment journey – that is full of emotion!\n\nIn case you want to revisit parts 1-3, here are the links: \n\n*   *   Part 1: [The Raiz-opaedia of Financial Language (A to C)](https://raiz.com.my/blog/the-raiz-opaedia-of-financial-language-a-to-c/) \n    *   Part 2: [The Raiz-opaedia of Financial Language (D to F)](https://raiz.com.my/blog/the-raiz-opaedia-of-financial-language-d-to-f/)  \n    *   Part 3: [The Raiz-opaedia of financial language (G to I)](https://raiz.com.my/blog/the-raiz-opaedia-of-financial-language-g-to-i/) \n\nReady? Let’s continue for the next alphabets – M and N!\n\n__Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)__\n\nWhen two or more separate entities combine forces. Examples; \n\n*   *   Celcom Axiata Bhd + Digi.Com Bhd = Celcom Digi Bhd \n    *   AmBank Group bought 100% MBf Cards Sdn Bhd \n    *   SapuraCrest Petroleum Bhd + Kencana Petroleum Bhd = SapuraKencana Petroleum Bhd\n\nThis could happen in many ways;\n\n*   *   Some are direct competitors like Celcom and Digi.\n    *   A company and its supplier/customer along its supply chain.\n\nWhy did companies decide to merge? It could be to achieve higher growth and market share, diversification to reduce loss, and tax benefits. \n\n__Monetary Policy__\n\nPolicy which the Central Bank control the interest rate and money supply to make sure the sustainability of economic growth.\n\nAs you can see during this COVID-19 pandemic, Bank Negara has lowered the Overnight Policy Rate (OPR) to encourage more borrowing and spending. And vice versa.\n\nThe goal is to keep the economy in the best condition – not too cold or hot, like your *teh tarik*.\n\n__Net Asset Value (NAV)__\n\nIt represents the price per unit of a fund, calculated on each business day.\n\n__Net Worth__\n\nThe value of all your __assets__ minus all your __liabilities__, or simply your debts. It helps you in understanding your current financial situation to better plan your financial goals. It provides a measure of your progress in accumulating financial wealth and the progress you’re making toward paying off your debt.\n\n__Assets__ – when you add up the value of everything you own (such as your house and the cash in your bank account).\n\nExample: \n\n*   *   Ali has RM10,200 in ASB.\n    *   Ali has a house valued at RM360,000.\n    *   Ali has a 3-year old Myvi car, and if he were to sell it, he will get RM20,000.\n    *   So, Ali’s total assets are __RM390,200__.\n\n__Liabilities__ – when you add up the value of all your debts (such as your house loan, car loan or credit card balances).\n\nExample:\n\n*   *   Ali’s house still has bank loan balance of RM200,000 to settle.\n    *   Ali has a 3-year old Myvi car that still has bank loan balance of RM34,000 to settle.\n    *   Ali has RM2,000 credit card balance.\n    *   So, Ali’s total liabilities are __RM236,000__.\n\nNet Worth = Assets – Liabilities.\n\nSo, Ali’s net worth is __RM390,200__ – __RM236,000__ = __+RM154,200.__\n\nTheoretically, your net worth is the cash you would have if you were to sell everything you own and paid off all your debts. A negative net worth is an indication that you have more debts than your assets.\n\n---\n\n### Don’t have the Raiz App?\n\nDownload it for free in the App store:\n\n[![](https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app.png)](https://app.adjust.com/4vnqz2h_q39miv7?fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.raiz.com.my%2Fregistration)\n\n__*Important Information*__\n\n*The information on this website is general advice only.
