Stocks can be bought and sold on several exchanges. In Malaysia we have __Bursa Malaysia__. In the US, there is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).\n\nStocks here means __equities__.\n\nThe stocks first become available on an exchange after a company puts its shares on the exchange; this is initial public offering __(IPO)__.

And then another person offers to buy those shares at a higher amount.
