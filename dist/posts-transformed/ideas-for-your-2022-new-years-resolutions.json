It is common for saving and investing more to be in people’s top five resolutions.\n\nNot sure what your new year’s money resolutions should be? Here are some ideas.\n\n__Commit to paying yourself first__\n\nWhen you get your salary, many people often spend first, and then save the balance. The problem with this is that it doesn’t guarantee any regular savings; your savings could become dependent on how much you spend each month.\n\nIn 2022, __let’s pay yourself first__ by setting aside a fixed percentage of your income towards saving and investing (example: 10%), and then only spend what is left.\n\nAutomation is your friend if this is your resolution, which can automatically put the money straight out of your bank account before you have a chance to spend it. Setting up a recurring deposit into your Raiz account is one way to do this.\n\n__Create (and stick to) a budget__\n\nThe problem with most budgets is we often become disengaged with them, leading us far from our initial plan. __A simple 50/30/20 budget can be a good place to start with budgeting since they are relatively easy to follow:__\n\n*   Use up to 50% of your income for what you need.\n*   Allow for up to 30% to spend on the fun stuff.\n*   Save 20% for a rainy day, investing or your savings goal (like buying a house).\n\nThese numbers aren’t necessarily fixed; however, they provide a strong foundation for building healthy financial habits to help you achieve your goals.\n\n__Choose a savings goal and start working towards it__\n\nThe previous tips are good behavioural changes to help you start managing your money better and saving more, however it’s also good to have a goal to work towards.\n\nSome common savings goals you could consider are:\n\n*   Build an emergency fund – The last two years during the COVID-19 pandemic have shown us why having one of these can be so important.\n*   Save for a holiday – We all need one after what happened in 2021 and travel might become easier in 2022.\n*   Save for a house deposit – Buying a house is a big financial life decision. If you’re planning to buy in the future, the best time to start saving is now.\n*   Pay down any debt you have – It’s simple, debt is not your friend if you’re trying to save!\n*   Save for retirement – If you don’t have any immediate money goals that come to mind, it’s generally a good idea to build up your retirement savings.\n\n__Challenge yourself to save RM1,000 in a year__\n\nRM1,000 sounds like a lot, but over a year this actually isn’t too difficult to achieve. We all like a challenge to get fit or lose weight or to meet another goal. Saving and investing is no different. If you save just RM20 per week, you’ll put away RM1,040 in a year!\n\nIf you have not already set up a recurring deposit or savings goal with Raiz, then setting one up and investing RM20 weekly into your Raiz account could help you achieve this!\n\n---\n\n__*Important Information*__\n\n*The information on this website is general advice only.
