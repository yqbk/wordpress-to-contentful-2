  "body": "![](https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/For-eDM.png)\n\n[__Klik sini untuk Bahasa Melayu__](https://raiz.com.my/blog/patut-ke-saya-keluarkan-semua-duit-saya-di-raiz-pelaburan-dari-pov-kami/)\n\nA Raizer called today. She asked ‚Äì politely ‚Äì ‚ÄúI have made an RM1,000 one-off deposit early this year. To date, my account balance is now RM939. That is -6.1% already. __Why is it lower? What should I do? Should I withdraw all my money now?__ This is my first time investing using my money. Please help.‚Äù.\n\n__Why is it lower?__\n\nIn investing, there are ups and downs. When you invest, you practically buy units of shares at a price.\n\nThe price goes up and down according to share market movement.\n\n__Now let‚Äôs look at the share market performance.__\n\nUS market (S&P 500 index) is down 21.1% since January this year.\n\nAt home, our market (FBM KLCI) is down 8.7% year-to-date.\n\nAs you can see, the customer‚Äôs investment is down 6.1% ‚Äî this is still technically better than the market performance. Why? Because with Raiz, you don‚Äôt invest in a single share. You invest in a portfolio of shares in many markets globally. So, when one share goes down, another goes up, it is eventually balanced out. This is the importance of diversification.\n\n__So, what should the customer do, and should she withdraw all her money?__\n\nWhat she is seeing is just a loss on paper ‚Äì it is not realized until you act upon it. If you withdraw, you practically sell all your units. If you sell at a lower price than you bought, you make a loss. If you sell it higher, you make a profit. Buy low, sell high. So instead of telling her whether or not to withdraw, we told her to take the opportunity of the current low price. Buy more units so your average cost per unit gets lower so when the market bounces back, you will be back in the green faster. This is actually [ringgit cost averaging](https://raiz.com.my/blog/the-advantages-of-ringgit-cost-averaging/).\n\nRemember, every market downturn in the past has ended up higher. A market downturn is an opportunity. Don‚Äôt get carried away with emotions.\n\nRaiz is designed for 1st-time investors. We help build your investment portfolio, we let you invest using a small amount of money, and we automate your investing process so you can invest regularly. These are all key to having a healthier balance in the long run.\n\nHappy investing!\n\n---\n\n### Don‚Äôt have the Raiz App?\n\nDownload it for free in the App store:\n\n[![](https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app.png)](https://app.adjust.com/4vnqz2h_q39miv7?fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.raiz.com.my%2Fregistration)\n\n__*Important Information*__\n\n*The information on this website is general advice only.
