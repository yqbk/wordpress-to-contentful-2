Get on top of your budget</strong></p>\n<p>There’s little chance you’ll be able to save much money if you’re not keeping good track of your cash. Therefore, it’s important to create a budget — and stick to it.</p>\n<p>When it comes getting your budget started, kick things off by looking at your income and expenses. Once you’ve established your income —your salary and other types of money gains — figure out what you’re spending that money on. This includes fixed costs like rent and food as well as optional spends such as entertainment and non-essential shopping.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>2. Cut your expenses where you can</strong></p>\n<p>There’s no point in just knowing where you’re spending your money – that’s only half the battle. The key is cutting spending so you can allocate more money to your savings. Although depending on your situation during the current economic environment, it may be a much harder time than usual to do this.</p>\n<p>Some common strategies include seeking out better deals on your regular payments — things like phone bills. It could also pay off to switch to cheaper brands of clothing and food or cut down on under-utilised subscription services like Netflix.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>3. What about investing?</strong></p>\n<p>The Raiz Philosophy is to invest small amounts regularly, even in falling markets as this can help you to ride out the downturns in the market and is one of the keys to having a healthier balance over the long run. This principle is known as <a href=\"https://raiz.com.my/blog/the-advantages-of-ringgit-cost-averaging/\">Ringgit Cost Averaging</a>.</p>\n<p>Compounding happens when you let the returns on an investment build up so that you are earning a return on your return. Given enough time to work its magic, it provides the potential to reach a stage in your life where your money is working hard enough to provide a substantial part of your income.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>4. Build an emergency fund</strong></p>\n<p>Building your savings should be about achieving your financial goals, but don’t forget to also prepare for when times get tough – the current coronavirus pandemic for example. This is where an emergency fund can be super helpful. Click <a href=\"https://raiz.com.my/blog/3-ways-to-build-up-your-emergency-fund/\">here</a> to learn about the 3 steps to build up your emergency fund.</p>\n<p>Depending on your situation, you may need to build a big emergency fund or one that just needs to get you through a few weeks without a regular income.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Whatever you may need money for down the track, it makes sense to prepare for a financial back up in order to soften the unexpected bumps along the road.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><span data-contrast=\"none\">Don’t have the Raiz App?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Download it for free in the App store:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3372\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/4vnqz2h_q39miv7?fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.raiz.com.my%2Fregistration\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-98\" src=\"https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app.png 351w, https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app-320x77.png 320w\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"72\" /></a></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Important Information</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The information on this website is general advice only.

Let’s do it.</p>\n<p><!--more--></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> How much do you need?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>It’s important to build up an emergency savings fund to prepare for the unexpected, whether that’s your car breaking down or a drop in income. A rough guide for the ideal sum to have saved is the amount you’d need to cover <strong>three months’ </strong>essential outgoings. So, if you spend RM1,500 a month on mortgage or rent, food, bills and other things you can’t live without, aim for RM4,500 in emergency savings. But if this figure seems unrealistic, don’t be daunted by it. Even having just a small amount saved can help you avoid taking on debt if you face unexpected costs.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> How much can you save?</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Work out how much you can afford to save each month. Go through your income and spending, there are many useful budget planners in app store (just search for “budget planner” for example).</p>\n<p>See where you can cut back like if you can save on bills, for example, could you cut the cost of your phone bill by switching providers? This could be extra cash for your fund. Once you know how much you can afford to put away each month, try setting up a standing order that automatically puts money into your savings account each month to help you achieve your goal.</p>\n<p>Try using less cash and instead more traceable sources such as debit cards, online banking and credit cards. This way you can monitor your money through statements and stay ahead of your finances.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Remember, it takes time!</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>While you’ll want to get your emergency fund set up as soon as possible, like with all savings, it’s best to keep to what you can afford and make sure to save regularly.</p>\n<p>Saving smaller but regular amounts are more effective than saving larger amounts now. This is because you <strong>get into the habit of saving</strong> and also avoid overcommitting too much. It can help you budget more effectively too. Or just save what you can as regularly as you can. Every bit of cash saved makes a big difference to your financial wellbeing.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<h3></h3>\n<h3><span data-contrast=\"none\">Don’t have the Raiz App?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Download it for free in the App store:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3372\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/4vnqz2h_q39miv7?fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.raiz.com.my%2Fregistration\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-98\" src=\"https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app.png\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" srcset=\"https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app.png 351w, https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app-320x77.png 320w\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"72\" /></a></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Important Information</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The information on this website is general advice only.

When it comes to this side of the ledger, you can split things up into dependable income, like your salary and things like capital gains from shares or dividends and examine what they look like now.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 11.25pt 0cm .0001pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Depending on your individual circumstances, you might find your income has a new baseline if your hours have been reduced or if you’ve been impacted by a layoff caused by recent economic disruption. However, your spending may have fallen more than before COVID, creating excess savings which could be put away for emergency before your expenses increase again. Doing this analysis now, after the forced cut backs in spending during COVID may give you a foundation to start reassembling a sustainable budget that works with your expected income during these difficult times.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Cut your expenses</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 11.25pt 0cm .0001pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">If you’re strapped for cash, the next thing you may want to do when figuring out your budget is look at how you’re spending your money and where you can make cuts. Some of these cuts may have already happened due to COVID with the forced reduction in your discretionary expenses like shopping, eating out, subscriptions and holidays. On fixed costs such as rent, utilities and insurances, you can actively look for better deals or ask for payments to be temporarily suspended or deferred, then restarted as social distancing eases and your financial situation becomes more certain.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Take a close look at essentials</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 11.25pt 0cm .0001pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">With essential spending like housing, it also pays to get creative. For instance, if you’re renting, consider letting out a room to a lodger to help make up a sudden fall in income. Or, if you’re a home owner worried about falling behind on mortgage repayments, don’t hesitate to reach out to your lender about options for reducing your payments temporarily such as debt moratorium. You could also consider refinancing your home loan if that suits your particular financial circumstances.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">Money for a rainy day</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 11.25pt 0cm .0001pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">While some people may need to make fundamental changes to their budgets, today’s altered conditions also represent a chance to plan and safeguard against other unknown shocks that may occur down the track.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 11.25pt 0cm .0001pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">This is where building an emergency fund now is a smart idea. Just putting a small amount away on a regular basis can add up over time and make a big difference.</span></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 11.25pt 0cm .0001pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">How much you should aim to have in your emergency fund will differ from person to person, but it’s advisable that it can cover the basics like rent or mortgage repayments, food, loan repayments, transport, utilities, and phone and internet for two or three months.</span></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\"> </span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"margin: 0cm; margin-bottom: .0001pt; background: white;\"><strong><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">The final word</span></strong></p>\n<p style=\"background: white; margin: 11.25pt 0cm .0001pt 0cm;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #333333;\">In these unprecedented times, being as smart as possible with your money is more important than ever.

For SC to say a fund is compliant, they look at the business activity benchmarks and financial ratio benchmarks, while at the same time account for qualitative aspect which involves public perception or image of the company’s activities.</p>\n<p>However, the SECOND view coming from the Islamic local councils in Malaysia, both at state (Jawatankuasa Fatwa Negeri) and federal level (Jawatankuasa Fatwa Majlis Kebangsaan) — <strong>the funds are “<em>harus</em>”</strong>, for these obvious reasons;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>PNB’s mandate is to enrich the lives of the Bumiputeras, which majority are Muslims. PNB has some 14 million unitholders, of which about 80% are Bumi.</li>\n<li>PNB does not invest in “haram” shares” such as alcohol, gambling or tobacco stocks.</li>\n<li>There are limited number of Shariah-compliant equity instruments on Bursa Malaysia considering how much money PNB has to invest — PNB has RM312 billion to invest, but Shariah-compliant securities on Bursa Malaysia is only RM1.1 trillion (as at 31 Dec 2019).</li>\n<li>If PNB pulls out its share from the banking stocks – especially Maybank (KLSE: Maybank) where it owns majority of the shares – that would have a major negative economic impact on Bumi Muslims.</li>\n<li>If PNB did not have majority shares in Maybank, for instance, it will lessen the acceleration of Islamic finance in the country. Maybank Islamic is the largest Islamic banking group in Malaysia and ASEAN by assets.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Therefore, for the above obvious reasons, after considering and prioritising wider public interest (maslahah), keeping the investment in Maybank is regarded as an essential (<em>dharuriyyah</em>) – hence the ruling “<em>harus</em>”.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>In conclusion;</p>\n<ol>\n<li>From the SC – the funds are not Shariah-compliant.</li>\n<li>From the Jawatankuasa Fatwa – the funds are “<em>harus</em>”.</li>\n<li>There is no force if one wishes to invest or, indeed, to not invest at all. That’s why the principles of needs (<em>hajiyyah</em>) provide a certain flexibility and freedom (although not absolute) for the individual to choose.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>Wallahuaklam</em>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><small>Source:</small></em></p>\n<p><em><small>Bursa Malaysia, FAST BNM</small></em></p>\n<p><em><small>PNB Annual Report 2019</small></em></p>\n<p><em><small><a href=\"http://www.asnb.com.my\">www.asnb.com.my</a></small></em></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"http://www.pnb.com.my\"><small>www.pnb.com.my </small></a></em></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><span data-contrast=\"none\">Don&#8217;t have the Raiz App?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Download it for free in the App store:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3372\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/4vnqz2h_q39miv7?fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.raiz.com.my%2Fregistration\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-98\" src=\"https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"72\" srcset=\"https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app.png 351w, https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app-320x77.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Important Information</span></i></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><i><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The information on this website is general advice only.

You would have purchased more shares when prices were low so it will be more rewarding for you when the market recovers (because eventually, over the long-term, the market will go up again!). This is a well-known investment strategy, known as <a href=\"https://raiz.com.my/blog/the-advantages-of-ringgit-cost-averaging/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Ringgit Cost Averaging</span></a>. </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">And also, it helps you get away with <a href=\"https://raiz.com.my/blog/the-investment-roller-coaster/\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">emotional investing</span></a>. This happened to us all &#8212; you know, when stock market goes down, you feel frustrated, so you sell all your investment at lower price instead of “buy low, sell high” while it is actually the opportunity to buy more assets at a lower price!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Raiz helps you to automate these strategies – saving your spare change from your everyday purchase, easy setup of recurring investment daily / weekly / monthly. </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Raiz is about helping you save &amp; invest more – managed to save 2% of your salary is better than earning 2% return. We don’t promote ourselves as the best fund manager because we believe regular disciplined savings can help improve your financial position in the long run far quicker than choosing the best fund manager.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<hr />\n<h3><span data-contrast=\"none\">Don&#8217;t have the Raiz App?</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></h3>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"none\">Download it for free in the App store:</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_3372\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"><a href=\"https://app.adjust.com/4vnqz2h_q39miv7?fallback=https%3A%2F%2Fapp.raiz.com.my%2Fregistration\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignleft wp-image-98\" src=\"https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"72\" srcset=\"https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app.png 351w, https://raiz.com.my/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/download-app-320x77.png 320w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></figure>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em><strong>Important Information</strong></em></p>\n<p><em>The information on this website is general advice only.

DIY gifts. </strong></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Instead of buying super expensive gifts why not tak</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">e</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> the time and effort to give your partner a </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">gift that you</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">create yourself</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.

Handma</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">d</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">e gifts certainly will not look as good as </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">diamonds</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> or any other lavish gifts</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, but it carries more sentimental values and way cheaper.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>4. Spend time together. </strong></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">You don’t have to reserve a fancy place just to celebrate valentine’s day together with your partner. You can just simply spend time together at home watching movies, chatting with each other, play games or other simple activities</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> that you both can enjoy.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> Valentine’s day is not about buying gifts, it is more about spending time with each other and show your partner how </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">much they</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> mean to you. It can also save your money </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">and time to make a reservation at a restaurant.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>5. Gift of service. </strong></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Another creative idea that you can use on valentine’s day is </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">a gift of service</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. You can create your own coupon book that contains the things you would do for your partner, such as doing the laundry</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> for a week, washing a car, an hour massage and many other romantic gestures that don’t cost you anything</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and what your partner maybe hate to do</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">It’s a simple </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">everyday chore</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> that </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">c</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">an touch your partner’s heart</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> and when you offer the service to help do it for them, that is an offer they can’t resist and be thankful for.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><strong>6. Take them for fun activity. </strong></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Instead of taking your partner to a restaurant, why not take them to go bowling</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">, take a walk or maybe </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">take her </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">on a</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> hike</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> instead? Doing </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">outdoor activity surrounded by nature </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">is a good change of air of what usually been done on Valentine’s Day. You can share a good conversation while taking pictures</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> with beautiful nature scenery as a background</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;134233279&quot;:true,&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559685&quot;:720,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">At the end of the day, you don’t need to</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> empty your wallet </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">to</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">impress</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">the one you lov</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">e</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">. </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Just giv</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">ing your time and show your feelings through a simple handwritten letter or handmade gift can make them feel appreciated and make the day more memorable.</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Sometimes,</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> small simple things</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">are</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> more meaningful than something lavish.

Or, ideally, do both at the same time.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span><!--more--></p>\n<p aria-level=\"3\"><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p aria-level=\"3\"><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Spending less</span></b><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335559738&quot;:40,&quot;335559739&quot;:0,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p aria-level=\"3\"><span data-contrast=\"auto\">There’s no reason to wait on cutting your spending back — you can spend less immediately.

If this is you, it’s likely your fixed costs — things like rent and transport — could be tough to dramatically reduce.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Earning more</span></b></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">The benefit of earning more isn’t hard to see — the more you earn, the more financial options you have, which potentially puts you on a path to financial security and abundance. However, one downside of aiming to earn more is that it involves risk.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Often, looking to earn more involves stepping out of your comfort zone, whether that means retraining, changing jobs, starting your own company, or going out solo as a freelancer in the gig economy.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Also, just because you earn more doesn’t mean you’ll have more money at the end of the day. Sometimes it’s the case that you end up spending more when your earnings increase, making fiscal discipline </span><span data-contrast=\"auto\">all the more</span><span data-contrast=\"auto\"> important as you climb the ladder of wealth.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><b><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Why not spend less and earn more?</span></b></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Remember, there’s always the danger that you end up having less time — and inferior quality of life — if your increased earnings mean you end up working around the clock.</span><span data-ccp-props=\"{&quot;201341983&quot;:0,&quot;335551550&quot;:1,&quot;335551620&quot;:1,&quot;335559739&quot;:160,&quot;335559740&quot;:259}\"> </span></p>\n<p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Ultimately, it’s about balance.
